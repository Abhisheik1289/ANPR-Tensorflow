# ANPR-Tensorflow

Using neural networks to build an automatic number plate recognition system. See [mattherwearl's blog post](http://matthewearl.github.io/2016/05/06/cnn-anpr/) for an explanation.

!NOTE:  This is an experimental project and is incomplete in a number of ways. This project is for be test it in Windows 10, the specific version Dependecies, and the code has been modify to generate licence plate patterns from Ecuador.

## Dependencies:

* [Python 3.6.2 (64bits)](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-362/)
* Numpy
* OpenCV(cv2)
* [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/install_windows)
